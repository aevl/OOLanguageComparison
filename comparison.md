### 1. Language purpose/genesis 
 ##### Why was the language created?
 Java: Java was created to replace C/C++, be more portable, and enable creation of web applications  
 (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/javahistory-index-198355.html)
 C#: C# was developed with C/C++ in mind to help programmers move to a more portable platform. 
 ##### What problems was the language trying to address?
 Java: Java was an attempt to solve problems in operating in a distributed computing enviroment by making itself available to multiple systems instead of just one.  
 C#: C# addressed the problems of C/C++ not being portable. 
 ##### Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
 Java: Java was meant to act as a replacement for C/C++  
 C#: C# isn't so much a replacement as an extension of C/C++   

### 2. Unique features of the language
 ##### Does the language have any particularly unique features?
 Java: Has no pointers. 
 C#:  C# isn't really unique in that it is derived from it's predecessors. 

### 3. Name spaces
 ##### How are name spaces implemented?
 Java: Packages in Java cannot be nested. One source file can only have one package statement. EXAMPLE  
 C#: EXAMPLE  
 ##### How are name spaces used?
 Java: Packages are used to organize files or public types to avoid type conflicts  
 C#: Namespaces are used to organize programs  

### 4. Types
 ##### What types does the language support?
 Java: Primitive data types aren't objects. There is no primative string. 
 C#: Primitive data types are objects. Value type variables can be assigned a value directly. They are derived from the class System.ValueType. The value types directly contain data. Some examples are int, char, and float, which stores numbers, alphabets, and floating point numbers, respectively. There is a primitive string.  (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173104.aspx)  
 ##### Are both reference and value types supported?
 Java: Java manipulates objects by reference but doesn't pass method arguments. It only passes values. 
 C#: Objects aren't passed at all. Objects are passed by value. A reference type cannot contain a null.
 ##### Can new value types be created?
 Java: You can create a new value type.  
 C#: You cannot derive a new value type in C#.  

### 5. Classes
 ##### Defining
 ##### Creating new instances
 ##### Constructing/initializing
 ##### Destructing/de-initializing
